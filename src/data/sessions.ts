There's no preparation needed.

Let the body take its seat—
upright, natural, unforced.

Feel the simple fact of being here.

[pause 20s]

The breath is already happening.

You don't need to follow it.

Let it move in the background,
like something familiar you don't have to watch.

What matters is the openness in which it appears.

[pause 20s]

Thoughts will come.
Sensations will shift.

That's not a disturbance.
That's the texture of being alive.

Let experience move as it does,
without taking a position.

Like standing in weather
without trying to improve the sky.

[pause 40s]

If effort shows up, notice it plainly.

No correction is needed.

Effort relaxes on its own
when it's seen clearly.

[pause 30s]

Now, very simply—
notice that you are aware.

Not of anything in particular.
Just aware.

Don't look for it.
Don't define it.

If nothing obvious appears,
stay there.

[pause 2 min]

Toward the end,
let the practice be unfinished.

There's nothing to conclude.

Let this quiet knowing
carry itself into the day.

Not as an object to observe,

Feel where the body is supported—
the chair, the floor, the ground beneath you.

You don't have to settle.
You're already held.

[pause 20s]

Bring attention gently to the lower belly.

There's no need to change the breath.

Just notice that breathing is happening there,
quietly, faithfully.

[pause 20s]

Let awareness sink downward—
out of the head,
through the throat and chest,
into the center of the body.

As if attention were a warm weight
slowly coming to rest.

[pause 30s]

Each inhale brings a simple wakefulness.

Each exhale allows a little more release.

Not letting go of anything—
just letting go into the body.

[pause 1 min]

Thoughts may continue above the surface.

Let them.

You don't need to push them away
to be grounded.

Like ripples on water,
they don't disturb the depth.

[pause 1 min]

Now feel the body as a single field.

Breath, sensation, weight, warmth—
all happening together.

There's no center you need to find.

No special place to rest attention.

The body knows how to be alive.

Awareness is simply keeping it company.

[pause 2 min]

If at any point you feel dull or disconnected,
return to one simple sensation—
the movement of the belly,
or the feeling of contact with the ground.

Let that be enough.

[pause 40s]

Toward the end,
sense the quiet dignity of having a body—
imperfect, aging, responsive, real.

This is not an obstacle to awareness.

It's one of its most honest expressions.

Rest here a moment longer.

Let the body settle enough
that you can feel your own presence.

There's no mood you need to create.

[pause 20s]

Sense the area of the chest.

Not to focus tightly—
just to notice that something lives there.

A responsiveness.
A quiet sensitivity.

[pause 30s]

You may imagine,
or simply feel,
a presence of compassion.

Not as a figure you must see,
but as a quality—
patient, unhurried, unafraid.

Let it be close.

[pause 30s]

As you inhale,
feel that presence meeting you.

As you exhale,
feel the chest soften a little.

Nothing dramatic.
Nothing forced.

[pause 40s]

Now, gently begin the mantra—
silently or aloud:

Om Mani Padme Hum

Let it move at its own pace.

You don't need to synchronize it perfectly
with the breath.

[pause 2 min, mantra continues]

If emotion arises—
warmth, sadness, irritation, numbness—
let it be included.

Compassion does not select
which feelings are allowed.

[pause 1 min]

If the mind wanders,
return to the sound of the mantra
or the simple feeling of presence in the chest.

No correction is needed.

[pause 1 min]

Toward the end,
allow the mantra to fade on its own.

Let the sense of compassion remain—
not directed,
not sent anywhere,
simply present.

[pause 40s]

You don't need to be kinder than you are.

Just don't turn away
from what's already here.

Rest for a few moments in that.

Now—
very simply—
notice that experience is happening.

Sounds are heard.
Sensations are felt.
Thoughts appear.

All of this is known.

[pause 20s]

Turn attention toward the knowing itself.

Not toward what is known—
but toward that which knows.

Don't try to locate it.

Just notice that it's already present.

[pause 30s]

If you look for awareness
and don't find anything in particular,
stay there.

The absence of an object
is not a failure.

[pause 40s]

Thoughts may continue.

Let them.

They don't interfere with knowing
unless you follow them.

There's no need to stop thinking
in order to recognize awareness.

[pause 1 min]

Now, drop even the gesture of looking.

Let attention relax back into itself.

No reference point.
No commentary.

Just this.

[pause 2 min]

If the mind tries to grasp this moment,
notice that grasping is also known.

Nothing needs to be corrected.

Recognition is already complete.

[pause 1 min]

Toward the end,
don't conclude the practice.

Let it remain unfinished.

Awareness does not begin or end
with this session.

Let it continue quietly
as you move back into the day.

The simple fact of moving through space.

Let awareness stay with the body

Movement happens.
Awareness notices.

It's already here—
in the step,
in the balance,

gently return to one simple sensation—
the feet on the ground,

from what comes next.

washing dishes,
speaking,
deciding,
pausing.

Feel where effort can be released.

Thoughts about the day may appear—
fragments, images, unfinished moments.

Let them come and go

Not disappearing—
just softening.

The edges blur.
The weight spreads out.

into the space around it.

can rest as it is.

even as thoughts thin out,
something quietly knows this moment.

You don't need to hold onto that knowing.

It holds itself.

If sleep comes, let it come.

If it doesn't,
let rest still happen.

Either way,
there is nothing more you need to do.

Let the night take care of itself.
